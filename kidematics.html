BEFORE AND AFTER SCHOOL

Our before and after school programs are operated at Cheat Lake Elementary and Suncrest Elementary. They focus on providing a structured before/afterschool experience with physical activity and social skills lessons. Each day the children rotate through different stations and are taught weekly lessons using our curriculum guide. Our before/afterschool programs provide a safe and structured environment for the children and encourage children to meet and exceed daily physical activity levels while also building healthy relationships and life skills.

*We DO NOT operate on snow days or when schools are closed. Our Morning programs DO NOT operate when there is a 2-hour delay and our afterschool programs DO NOT operate when there is a planned or unplanned 2-hour early dismissal.*
